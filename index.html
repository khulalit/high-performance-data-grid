          Dive into the world of handling massive datasets this data grid! Built
          to smoothly render up to a million rows (or maybe more not limit, not
          be honest just how you store is the issue), it offers smooth scrolling
          and razor-sharp responsiveness that keeps you in the flow. The secret?
          Intelligent virtualization that renders only the cells in view with
          virtualized scrolling, paired with very optimized and granular DOM
          updates. scrolling and a slick custom scrollbar for effortless
          navigation. Here, I am here only focused on taming the challenge of
          large-scale rendering. Storing and handling data is saved for the
          sequel. And this logic scales horizontally too, perfect for those epic
          wide datasets!
